 ☐ 
 ☐ PostprocessItem now supports blend states
 ☐ Added States to queues and layers
 ✔ Now begin() is called on the RenderLayer and no more on the individual queues, end() is still called on the individual render queues in order to specify shared parameters @done (16-02-23 22:56)
 ✔ Removed camy_test_if and removed modes for more flexible system @done (16-02-23 16:53)
 ✔ Fixed some header names and moving shader common in their own namespace @done (16-02-22 23:30)
 ☐ Slowly reworking the spatial code
 ☐ Working on removing pointers where not needed and thus decreasing awful if()s all around the code
 ✔ Common header for postprocess effect has been added camy/shaders/pp_common.hlsl @done (16-02-16 19:56)
 ✔ Now Renderer::render() accepts no viewport as parameter and uses the window_target size specified in Renderer::load() @done (16-02-16 19:54)
