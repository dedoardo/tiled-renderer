Fixes:
- Implement fullscreen 
- Check all destructor that call unload() such as RenderContext
- Smart pointers should have embedded allocation / deallocation and different types for Tallocate/deallocate

Cool stuff:
- Some kind of global illumination, either voxels or probes (Multi-Scale global illumination in Quantum Break)
- Real time area lighting
- Filmic/Temporal/Morphological AA
- Partecipating medias / raymarching volumes
- SSR
- Postprocessing
